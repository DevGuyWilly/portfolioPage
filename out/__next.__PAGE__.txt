5:T659,React has evolved significantly since its inception. With the introduction of **React Server Components (RSC)**, the way we build web applications is undergoing a fundamental shift.

## Why Server Components?

Traditionally, React rendered entirely on the client (CSR) or hydrated a server-rendered HTML payload (SSR). Both approaches required sending a significant amount of JavaScript to the browser to make the page interactive.

Server Components allow us to render components **exclusively on the server**. This means:

- **Zero Bundle Size**: Dependencies used in Server Components aren't sent to the client.
- **Direct Backend Access**: You can query databases directly inside your component without an API layer.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Client components imported by Server Components are automatically split.

## The Mental Model Shift

Thinking in RSC requires separating your app into the "Server Graph" and the "Client Graph".

- **Server Components**: Data fetching, secure logic, heavy dependencies.
- **Client Components**: Interactivity (useState, useEffect), browser APIs, event listeners.

This hybrid model offers the best of both worlds: the SEO and performance of server rendering with the rich interactivity of client-side apps.

## Conclusion

As Next.js and other frameworks adopt these patterns, mastering RSC is becoming essential for modern frontend developers. It's not just a performance optimization; it's a better way to architect scalable applications.6:T4bd,A Design System is more than just a UI kit—it's the single source of truth for your product's design language.

## Core Elements

1. **Design Tokens**: The atoms of your system. Colors, typography, spacing, and shadows defined as variables.
2. **Component Library**: Reusable, accessible UI elements like buttons, inputs, and cards.
3. **Documentation**: Guidelines on *how* and *when* to use these components.

## Atomic Design Methodology

Brad Frost's Atomic Design is a popular methodology for organizing design systems:

- **Atoms**: Basic HTML elements (Labels, Inputs, Buttons).
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms working together (Search Form).
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (Header, Sidebar).
- **Templates**: Page layouts without content.
- **Pages**: Final instances with real content.

## Why You Need One

Without a design system, products accumulate "design debt"—inconsistent colors, slightly different button styles, and confusing UX patterns. A robust system ensures consistency, speeds up development, and improves collaboration between designers and developers.7:T428,Animation on the web used to be hard. CSS transitions are limited, and Web API animations are verbose. Enter **Framer Motion**.

## Declarative Animations

Framer Motion allows you to describe *what* you want to happen, not *how*.

```jsx
<motion.div 
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
/>
```

## Layout Animations

One of the most powerful features is the `layout` prop. It automatically animates changes in layout, such as reordering a list or resizing a card, with zero calculation required from you.

## Gestures

Adding hover, tap, and drag interactions is trivial:

- `whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}`
- `whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}`
- `drag`

## Shared Layout Transitions

With `layoutId`, you can animate components between different parts of the tree, creating seamless morphing effects like the ones seen in the App Store or Spotify.

Framer Motion makes these high-fidelity interactions accessible to every React developer.0:{"buildId":"-C4r3gEgimXb-B06s3AiS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col min-h-full","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{"projects":[{"id":"1","title":"App Launch","slug":"app-launch","excerpt":"I'm proud to announce the launch of the app I've been working the past 2 years on.
